# MP_FooBar
While searching some for help with my General Assembly class I got an invite to the Google FooBar challenges.
Included in this Repo are the challenges I've gotten and completed so far. If you have anyquestions, hit me up at themp731@gmail.com

If you've been invited to the foo.bar with Google challenges this might be useful. I've only been doing this python thing part time for a couple months so pardon my poor naming conventions, bad style etc. I tried to comment what I was doing, to give some background, hopefully it's clear enough.

Some of the problems encountered so far in the Foobar (foo bar? foo.bar?) are:
<ul>
<li> Minion Interrogation
<li> Naming Minions
<li> Minion Bored Games
<li> And a scheduling problem for rabbits
</ul>
